# Architecture and Data Privacy

## Client-Server Model

OwlTable is designed with a strong emphasis on data privacy and security. Our architecture ensures that your sensitive database information never leaves your control.

*   **Client-Side Application:** The core OwlTable application is installed and runs entirely within your own server environment. It directly connects to your databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Db2, SQL Server) to perform all management, monitoring, and analysis tasks.
*   **Our Server's Role:** Our servers are only used for two purposes:
    1.  **License Management:** To verify your subscription and license information.
    2.  **Application Downloads:** To provide a secure location for you to download the OwlTable application and any updates.

## Data Privacy

**Your data remains on your servers.** We do not have access to your database schemas, queries, or any of the data stored within your databases. All data processing and analysis happens locally on your infrastructure. This design ensures the highest level of security and compliance for your organization.
