### 📝 **Schema Control: Deploy with Confidence**
*   **Prevent Drift:** Compare database schemas across environments (dev, test, prod) to catch unintended changes before they cause issues.
*   **Audit:** Maintain a complete, versioned history of all schema modifications.

### ⚡ **Performance Tuning: From Slow to Fast**
*   **Pinpoint Bottlenecks:** Automatically identify inefficient SQL queries and performance traps that are slowing down your applications.
*   **Get Actionable Fixes:** Receive intelligent, context-aware suggestions, such as indexing recommendations and query rewrites, to resolve issues instantly.

### 📊 **Capacity Planning: Stay Ahead of Growth**
*   **Forecast Future Needs:** Visualize historical data growth trends to accurately predict future storage requirements and avoid surprises.
*   **Integrate & Monitor:** Connect with external monitoring systems like OpenTelemetry for a unified view of your infrastructure's health.

### 🔒 **Test Data Management: Better Testing, Less Risk**
*   **Generate Safe Test Data:** Securely populate lower environments with production-like data, using built-in data subsetting and masking to protect sensitive information.
*   **Accelerate Development:** Provide developers with the realistic data they need to build and test features more effectively.

### ⚙️ **Automation: Automate Tedious Tasks**
*   **Simplify Backups:** Schedule and automate database backups to ensure your data is always protected without manual intervention.

## ✨ Pro Features

These features expand OwlTable's capabilities to support more complex environments and provide advanced, proactive management tools for mission-critical systems.

### 🌐 **Expanded Compatibility: Connect to Any Database**
*   **NoSQL Support:** Introducing support for MongoDB.
*   **Cloud-Native:** Adding first-class support for major cloud databases like Amazon RDS and Azure SQL Database.

### 🚨 **Proactive Diagnostics: Find Issues Before They Happen**
*   **Smart Alerts:** Receive predictive alerts for critical issues, such as running out of disk space, before they impact your services.
*   **Automated Root Cause Analysis:** Move beyond alerts to diagnosis. OwlTable will automatically identify the root cause of performance problems, saving you hours of troubleshooting.

### 🔁 **Advanced Versioning: Total Control Over Your Database**
*   **Full Database Versioning:** Treat your entire database as a versioned artifact, enabling complex deployment and rollback strategies.
*   **Powerful CLI:** A full-featured Command-Line Interface (CLI) that can connect to the main application via REST calls and can also be used as a plugin for CI/CD pipelines to enable advanced automation and deeper integration into infrastructure-as-code workflows, including AI-assisted query creation.

### 🧠 **AI-Assisted SQL Building: Write Code Faster & Safer**
*   **Natural Language to SQL:** Write SQL statements by simply describing what you want in plain English (e.g., "Find all users from California who logged in last week"). This feature uses an LLM installed on the client's server to translate text into SQL statements. It can be included as a feature in the advanced tier, or as an extra paid feature for the basic and pro tiers.
*   **Schema-Aware Suggestions:** The AI provides contextually relevant column and table name suggestions as you type, significantly reducing syntax errors and speeding up development.
*   **Query Optimization on Creation:** Get immediate feedback and suggested rewrites for the SQL statement you just created, ensuring performance best practices are baked in from the start.

### 📡 **Distributed Systems Support: Manage at Scale**
*   **Cluster-Aware:** Introducing features specifically designed for managing and monitoring distributed database environments, such as clusters and sharded databases.
