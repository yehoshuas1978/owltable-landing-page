This is a critical differentiator for organizations with strict data privacy and compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). 2. Unified &amp; Comprehensive One tool to rule them all. OwlTable integrates schema control, performance tuning, data masking, and automation into a single, cohesive platform. This eliminates the need for multiple, disjointed tools, reducing complexity and cost. 3. Developer-Centric Workflow Built for modern development. With CI/CD integration, automated test data generation, and a future-proof roadmap including a CLI, OwlTable is designed to fit seamlessly into automated, agile development cycles."},{"location":"business_plan/#3-saas-pricing-model","title":"3.
