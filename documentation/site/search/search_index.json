Our architecture ensures that your sensitive database information never leaves your control. Client-Side Application: The core OwlTable application is installed and runs entirely within your own server environment. It directly connects to your databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Db2, SQL Server) to perform all management, monitoring, and analysis tasks. Our Server's Role: Our servers are only used for two purposes: License Management: To verify your subscription and license information. Application Downloads: To provide a secure location for you to download the OwlTable application and any updates. Data Privacy Your data remains on your servers. We do not have access to your database schemas, queries, or any of the data stored within your databases. All data processing and analysis happens locally on your infrastructure. This design ensures the highest level of security and compliance for your organization.","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"architecture/#architecture-and-data-privacy","text":"","title":"Architecture and Data Privacy"},{"location":"architecture/#client-server-model","text":"OwlTable is designed with a strong emphasis on data privacy and security.

Schema Version Control and Comparison: Compare database schemas between different environments (e.g., development, testing, production). Maintain a complete historical repository of all schema changes, allowing for easy auditing and rollback. Performance Monitoring and Tuning: Identify slow and inefficient queries that are impacting application performance. Suggest concrete improvements for identified performance issues, such as indexing recommendations and query refactoring. Capacity Planning and Monitoring: Monitor and visualize historical data growth trends. Provide disk space alerts to proactively manage storage capacity. Test Data Management: Securely transfer data from production to development environments. Includes data subsetting (to reduce data volume) and data masking (to protect sensitive information). Operational Automation: Schedule and automate database backups. Integrate with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins) to automate database changes and data management tasks. ERD Visualization: Visualize and export a table relationship graph (ERD). Version 2 (V2) - Enterprise-Ready Capabilities The second version of OwlTable will expand its reach to support more complex environments and introduce advanced analytical and operational capabilities. Expanded Database Support: Support for MongoDB. Support for cloud databases (e.g., Amazon RDS, Azure SQL Database). Advanced Alerting and Diagnostics: Integration with popular alerting and monitoring systems. Predictive analytics for proactive issue detection. Automated root cause diagnosis for performance problems. Enhanced Versioning and Automation: Database versioning to track and manage different database states. Advanced rollback options for safe and reliable deployments. Full-featured CLI support to enable seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines. Distributed Environment Support: Support for managing and monitoring databases in distributed environments.","title":"Features"},{"location":"features/#features","text":"","title":"Features"},{"location":"features/#version-1-v1-core-functionality","text":"The initial release of OwlTable will focus on providing a robust and comprehensive foundation for database management.
